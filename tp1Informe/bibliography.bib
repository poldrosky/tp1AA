  abstract = {Observations from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer ({MODIS)} were used in combination with a large data set of field measurements to map woody above-ground biomass ({AGB)} across tropical Africa. We generated a best-quality cloud-free mosaic of {MODIS} satellite reflectance observations for the period 2000{\textendash}2003 and used a regression tree model to predict {AGB} at 1 km resolution. Results based on a cross-validation approach show that the model explained 82\% of the variance in {AGB}, with a root mean square error of 50.5 Mg ha-1 for a range of biomass between 0 and 454 Mg ha-1. Analysis of lidar metrics from the Geoscience Laser Altimetry System ({GLAS)}, which are sensitive to vegetation structure, indicate that the model successfully captured the regional distribution of {AGB.} The results showed a strong positive correlation (R2 = 0.90) between the {GLAS} height metrics and predicted {AGB.}},

  abstract = {Regional-scale above-ground biomass ({AGB)} estimates of tropical savannas and woodlands are highly uncertain, despite their global importance for ecosystems services and as carbon stores. In response, we collated field inventory data from 253 plots at four study sites in Cameroon, Uganda and Mozambique, and examined the relationships between field-measured {AGB} and cross-polarized radar backscatter values derived from {ALOS} {PALSAR}, an L-band satellite sensor. The relationships were highly significant, similar among sites, and displayed high prediction accuracies up to 150 Mg ha-1 ({\textpm}\~{}20\%). {AGB} predictions for any given site obtained using equations derived from data from only the other three sites generated only small increases in error. The results suggest that a widely applicable general relationship exists between {AGB} and L-band backscatter for lower-biomass tropical woody vegetation. This relationship allows regional-scale {AGB} estimation, required for example by planned {REDD} (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) schemes.},

  abstract = {According to the {IPCC} {GPG} (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Good Practice Guidance), remote sensing methods are especially suitable for independent verification of the national {LULUCF} (Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry) carbon pool estimates, particularly the aboveground biomass. In the present study, we demonstrate the potential of standwise (forest stand is a homogenous forest unit with average size of 1{\textendash}3 ha) forest inventory data, and {ASTER} and {MODIS} satellite data for estimating stand volume (m3 ha- 1) and aboveground biomass (t ha- 1) over a large area of boreal forests in southern Finland. The regression models, developed using standwise forest inventory data and standwise averages of moderate spatial resolution {ASTER} data (15 m {\texttimes} 15 m), were utilized to estimate stand volume for coarse resolution {MODIS} pixels (250 m {\texttimes} 250 m). The {MODIS} datasets for three 8-day periods produced slightly different predictions, but the averaged {MODIS} data produced the most accurate estimates. The inaccuracy in radiometric calibration between the datasets, the effect of gridding and compositing artifacts and phenological variability are the most probable reasons for this variability. Averaging of the several {MODIS} datasets seems to be one possibility to reduce bias. The estimates obtained were significantly close to the district-level mean values provided by the Finnish National Forest Inventory; the relative {RMSE} was 9.9\%. The use of finer spatial resolution data is an essential step to integrate ground measurements with coarse spatial resolution data. Furthermore, the use of standwise forest inventory data reduces co-registration errors and helps in solving the scaling problem between the datasets. The approach employed here can be used for estimating the stand volume and biomass, and as required independent verification data.},

  abstract = {Spatially and temporally explicit knowledge of biomass dynamics at broad scales is critical to understanding how forest disturbance and regrowth processes influence carbon dynamics. We modeled live, aboveground tree biomass using Forest Inventory and Analysis ({FIA)} field data and applied the models to 20+ year time-series of Landsat satellite imagery to derive trajectories of aboveground forest biomass for study locations in Arizona and Minnesota. We compared three statistical techniques (Reduced Major Axis regression, Gradient Nearest Neighbor imputation, and Random Forests regression trees) for modeling biomass to better understand how the choice of model type affected predictions of biomass dynamics. Models from each technique were applied across the 20+ year Landsat time-series to derive biomass trajectories, to which a curve-fitting algorithm was applied to leverage the temporal information contained within the time-series itself and to minimize error associated with exogenous effects such as biomass measurements, phenology, sun angle, and other sources. The effect of curve-fitting was an improvement in predictions of biomass change when validated against observed biomass change from repeat {FIA} inventories. Maps of biomass dynamics were integrated with maps depicting the location and timing of forest disturbance and regrowth to assess the biomass consequences of these processes over large areas and long time frames. The application of these techniques to a large sample of Landsat scenes across North America will facilitate spatial and temporal estimation of biomass dynamics associated with forest disturbance and regrowth, and aid in national-level estimates of biomass change in support of the North American Carbon Program.},
